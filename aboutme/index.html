            <p class="aboutme">
                My name is Kyle Kerr.<br>
                I am a 19-year-old who hails from Oregon City, OR.<br>
                I am a Web Design and Development Major. Therefore I want to do well in this class.<br>
                I enjoy playing Settlers of Catan, Minecraft, Rook, and Clash of Clans.<br>
                I love hanging out with friends/roommates.<br>
                My favorite movie is <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em>.<br>
                I have been a lifelong member of the church.<br>
                My toothbrush is blue, like what the color of this page was supposed to be until my .css file decided to not work.
